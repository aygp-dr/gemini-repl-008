#+AUTHOR: AYGP-DR Team
#+DATE: 2025-07-24

* Executive Summary

Gemini REPL 008 is a Ruby implementation of an interactive REPL for Google's Gemini AI, incorporating lessons learned from 7 previous implementations across multiple languages. This version prioritizes fast startup (<300ms), security-first design, and the critical tool capabilities identified through production usage analysis.

** Key Insights from Previous Versions

1. *Tool Usage Statistics* (from Claude Code analytics):
   - Shell commands: 53% of all operations
   - File editing: 11% 
   - File reading: 11%
   - Task management: 10%
   - File writing: 10%

2. *Critical Issues Discovered*:
   - API parameter handling complexity (gemini-repl-007 #1)
   - Need for daemon mode for CI/CD (gemini-repl-007 #14)
   - JSON parsing fragility in Python implementations
   - Security sandboxing must be present from day one

3. *Architectural Patterns*:
   - Literate programming approach (from 006)
   - Experiment-driven development (from 007)
   - Protocol-based tool abstraction
   - Session-based context management

* Documentation Structure

This project follows a documentation-first approach with these key documents:

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [[file:README.org][README.org]] | User-facing documentation and quick start | ✓ Complete |
| [[file:REQUIREMENTS.org][REQUIREMENTS.org]] | Formal system requirements and specifications | ✓ Complete |
| [[file:RUBY-GEMINI-REPL.org][RUBY-GEMINI-REPL.org]] | Literate programming implementation guide | ✓ Complete |
| [[file:GITHUB-SETUP.org][GITHUB-SETUP.org]] | GitHub labels, milestones, and project setup | ✓ Complete |
| [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] | Build automation and development tasks | ✓ Complete |
| [[file:.gitignore][.gitignore]] | Git ignore patterns | ✓ Complete |

* Implementation Priorities

Based on production usage data and lessons learned:

** Phase 1: Core REPL (Week 1)
1. Basic REPL loop with Readline
2. Gemini API integration with proper error handling
3. Session management and persistence
4. Core slash commands
5. Structured logging

** Phase 2: Essential Tools (Week 2)
Priority order based on usage statistics:
1. =run_command= (53% - highest usage)
2. =edit_file= (11% - critical for code modification)
3. =read_file= (11% - basic file operations)
4. =write_file= (10% - content creation)
5. =list_files= (part of basic operations)
6. =search_code= (enables code navigation)

** Phase 3: Production Features (Week 3)
1. Daemon mode for CI/CD integration
2. Security sandboxing hardening
3. Performance optimization
4. Comprehensive test coverage

** Phase 4: Polish (Week 4)
1. Plugin architecture design
2. Documentation completion
3. RubyGems packaging
4. Community feedback incorporation

* Technical Decisions

** Language Choice: Ruby
- Fast startup compared to JVM languages
- Rich ecosystem for CLI tools
- Excellent metaprogramming for tool system
- Strong standard library
- Active community

** Key Dependencies
- =faraday= - HTTP client with middleware support
- =readline= - Interactive input handling
- =rspec= - Testing framework
- =rubocop= - Code style enforcement
- =yard= - Documentation generation

** Architecture Highlights
1. *Modular Design*: Clear separation between API, REPL, and tools
2. *Security First*: Sandboxing built into tool execution
3. *Observable System*: Structured logging with trace IDs
4. *Extensible*: Plugin architecture planned from start
5. *Test-Driven*: High coverage requirements

* Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------+-------------------|
| API Changes | Abstract API layer with version detection |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Sandbox from day one, security audit milestone |
| Performance Issues | Profile early, <300ms startup requirement |
| Tool Execution Failures | Comprehensive error handling, dry-run mode |
| Platform Compatibility | Test on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Windows |

   - Recruit contributors
   - Plan for beta testing

* Lessons Applied

This implementation directly addresses issues discovered in previous versions:

1. *From gemini-repl-005 (Python)*:
   - Robust JSON parsing with fallbacks
   - Clear error messages
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. *From gemini-repl-006 (Clojure)*:
   - Literate programming approach
   - Clean architecture
   - Protocol-based abstractions

3. *From gemini-repl-007 (Python)*:
   - Daemon mode design
